# Kaomoji

The Discord kaomoji search engine.

Just type `/kaomoji` and start describing the kaomoji you want!

Then, you can copy the kaomoji with formatting characters escaped so that it
doesn't mess with Discord's message formatting when you send it.

As of **January 24th, 2025**, there are only **4** kaomojis. I'm gonna be adding
a ton more in the coming days. (^^')

If you'd like to, it's really easy to **add your own kaomoji**! Just open
`src/main.rs` and add your kaomoji to the `KAOMOJIS` static item near the top of
the file. For example:

```rs
static KAOMOJIS: &[Kaomoji] = &[
    // other komojis...
    Kaomoji {
        text: "(* ^ Ï‰ ^)",
        keywords: &["joyful", "happy", "smiley"],
    },
];
```

Next, you have to make a GitHub pull request. If you're not comfortable editing
code and making a pull request, you can also **just ask me to add a kaomoji**
and usually I will! You can [create an issue], [message me on Discord], or
[email me].
